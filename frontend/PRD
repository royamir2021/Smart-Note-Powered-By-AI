Smart Note-Taking Widget – Product Requirement Document (PRD)
1. Project Goal
Create a secure iframe widget that lets students take notes inside the LMS. Each note should be connected to the student’s course, unit, and lesson.

2. Key Features
API to create and fetch notes

Notes are auto-saved every few seconds

JWT-based authentication for security

Option to export notes to PDF or Word

Generate flashcards and quizzes using AI

3. API Requirements
POST /api/notes
Create a new note

Input: student_id, course_id, unit_number, lesson_title

Output: note_id, token, iframe URL

POST /api/notes/{note_id}/save
Save note content

Input: content (as JSON), title

Output: success message

GET /api/notes/{note_id}
Fetch a note

Requires JWT token

Output: full note content

4. Data Structure
notes table:

id

student_id

course_id

unit_number

lesson_title

title

content (stored as JSON)

created_at, updated_at

5. User Flow
The LMS sends student and course info to the API

The backend responds with a signed iframe URL and token

When the student opens the iframe, the note loads or a new one is created

While typing, the content is auto-saved every few seconds

When exporting or generating flashcards/quizzes, the content is sent to the AI API

6. Security
JWT tokens expire after 1 hour

Tokens must match the correct student and session

The iframe can only be embedded from the LMS domain (using Content-Security-Policy)

7. Auto-Save Logic
When the student stops typing, a request is sent after 2–3 seconds

A PATCH request updates the note

The UI shows the save status (e.g., “Saving...” or “Saved ✅”)
